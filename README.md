# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
The dataset used in this project originated from the marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution gathered over direct phone calls. The goal of this project is to predict whether client subscribed a term deposit (column "Y" value of "yes" or "no") using available independent variables.

The problem was solved using 2 different approaches: Logistic regression model which was optimised using HyperDrive Pipeline and with Azure AutoML.

Both methods yielded similar performance, with just over 90% accuracy. AutoML tried 50 models and the best performing one was the VotingEnsemble. 


## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
